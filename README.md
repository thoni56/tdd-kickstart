# Kickstart your TDD-ing

It is to seldom we start a new project from scratch, so we, at least
I, forget about all the boilerplating for all the languages and all
the test frameworks.

This little project will collect those templates so that you can just clone and copy the directory that most resembles your language and testing/mocking framwork.

The subdirectories here will have the following structure:

    <language> - <test framework> [ - <mocking framework> ]

This way it is easy to pick the closest and quickly go from there.

Each template should follow the same pattern, example and if at all
possible, be complete so that it can be run with example output once
copied.
